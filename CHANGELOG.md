# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. Migration milestones are separate from
product roadmap phases; M0 is the architecture behavior-freeze milestone.

## Unreleased

### Architecture migration M0 — 2026-10-27

#### Added

- Compatibility fixtures for both command help screens and multi-size reports,
  covering odd/even medians, ordered variants, positive/negative/zero changes,
  fractional timings, filtered variants, and missing/zero scalar baselines.
- Regression coverage for quick-comparison size, variant bindings, allocation
  columns, aliases, the full legacy size sweep, generated-input wraparound,
  and report validation before artifact creation.
- Tracked M0 migration contract defining operation/type/strategy identity,
  arithmetic and harness version boundaries, input fingerprint encoding,
  selector compatibility, and preservation of legacy raw artifacts.
- Native Windows/amd64 baseline with 162 observations and complete command,
  toolchain, hardware, source-revision, and measurement-boundary context.
- Actual two-group report smoke artifacts and reproduction instructions.

#### Validation

- Formatting, uncached tests, vet, and filtered report execution passed on
  Windows/amd64 with Go 1.27.3 and `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`.
- Local race tests could not build `runtime/cgo` (`cgo.exe` exits 2). This also
  affects the unchanged addition package; Linux CI remains the configured race
  check. No local Linux/arm64 execution is claimed.

#### Compatibility

- M0 characterizes existing behavior. Kernel implementations, timed loops,
  command defaults, report formats, and measurement algorithms are unchanged.
- M0 is complete. M1 result/rendering extraction and Feature 1 remain pending.
